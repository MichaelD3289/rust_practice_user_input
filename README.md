# User Input Practice

This is a project suggestion found while learning Rust [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html). The purpose of this project is to help learn Rust by building small projects.

# Goal

The goal of the code found here is to create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales”

Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.


# Extra Features

- Remove Keyword: On top of 'Add' a user may use 'Remove' to remove an employee from a department
  - Example: "Remove Sally from Engineering"


# Improvement Ideas
  - Better instructions to user when the program loads
    - `help` command that will give more detailed information on how to use
  - Better error messages detailing where the program went wrong and why
  - allowing a user to list the company they are updating when they start
  - saving the company data to a file that can be retrieved next time the user upates that company
  - list departments and employee seperately as well as grouped
